Creating a simple smart contract

This was created following a tutorial from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTC8BHrmrJA) YouTube video. I implemented knowledge of Solidity from the CryptoZombies course.

This smart contract allows a parent to deposit money into an account, and for their child to retrieve it after a certain amount of time has passed.
